# rag-forge — live demo

Ask a question about the indexed documents and watch the whole pipeline:
hybrid retrieval, cross-encoder reranking, verified span citations, and a grounding
gate that refuses rather than guessing.

Try one of the deliberately unanswerable questions — the system is built to say no.

Running on free CPU hardware with the small model profile and a SQLite index.
